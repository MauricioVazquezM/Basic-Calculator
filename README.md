## Objetive

- The main objective of this project is to program a calculator in the Java language. It seeks to take advantage of the concept of stack, and its implementation, seen in class. The concept of stack will be used to carry out necessary tasks in the operation of a calculator: verify that the expression is balanced with respect to the parentheses, go from an infix expression to a postfix expression, evaluate the data, etc.

## Problem requirements 

- The calculator must be able to perform four operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division). These operations can be performed with integers and decimals, both positive and negative, and the calculator must be able to recognize a hierarchy of operations. In addition, the calculator must have a graphical user interface (GUI), which will allow a more natural and accessible interaction between the user and the calculator. It is worth mentioning that the calculator will be developed in Netbeans.

## How to use the graphical interface

- The functionality of the graphical interface of the calculator is similar to that of any conventional calculator.

## Features

- Sum
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
